## Ready Draggable Sheet
***

Using \[DraggableScrollableSheet\] in practice.

This package focuses on using the \[DraggableScrollableSheet\] inside \[Overlay\] as a route, in addition to calculating the sizes of widgets that must be added to it before displaying it, in order not to fill the screen size unnecessarily, but this results in delaying the display of the list until after the end of the widgets rendering.

*The same widgets that are included in the overlay are used to calculate their sizes.
